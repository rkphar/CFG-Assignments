# Git and GitHub Assignment

## About Me

Hello, my name is Rajindeep Pharwaha, but you can call me **Raj**.
I live in Glasgow and I am a single parent of 2 daughters who are a handful(*especially* the youngest)
I have previously completed the ***Introduction to Python*** course through **Code Firt Girls** as well as a couple of short courses on ***Cyber Security*** through **Skills Development Scotland**

## Assignment

For this assignment, I downloaded **Git** and **GitHub** and set them up as shown in the setup guides. 
I started off by creating a repository called **GitTest** within GitHub and setting it as my master branch on Git. I then added 3 files to the repository to test that I could **add**, **commit** and **push** files to my repository on GitHub from Git.
