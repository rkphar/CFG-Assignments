# Git and GitHub Assignment

## About Me

Hello, my name is Rajindeep Pharwaha, but you can call me **Raj**.
I live in Glasgow and I am a single parent of 2 daughters who are a handful(*especially* the youngest)
I have previously completed the ***Introduction to Python*** course through **Code Firt Girls** as well as a couple of short courses on ***Cyber Security*** through **Skills Development Scotland**

## Assignment

For this assignment, I downloaded **Git** and **GitHub** and set them up as shown in the setup guides. 
I started off by creating a repository called **GitTest** within GitHub and setting it as my master branch on Git. I then added 4 files to the repository to test that I could **add**, **commit** and **push** files to my repository on GitHub from Git as shown below.

I also managed to make 2 branches. I created a **second** and **third** branch. The third branch is illustrated below, but the third branch was then deleted.

I also created a **.gitignore** and a **requirements.txt** file through GitHub which I found the easiest way to do it.

I created a new file in the second branch which was called pulltest.txt to test **pulling**, **branching** and **merging**. I managed to pull and branch through Git, but when merging, I found it easier to do this through GitHub.

I hope you are able to check all of my work on GitHub and all of the different changes which were made. I am aware I am still learning how to use Git and Github properly and it is all trial and error(mostly error just now ðŸ˜•)

Thank you
