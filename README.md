# Assignement 4 API

## Getting Started

In order to use this API, you will need to have **Flask** and **mysql.connector** downloaded on your pyCharm.
You will also need to run the database ***Pharaoh*** in SQL and have all of the **.py** files saved on your pyCharm.
Please ensure you have entered you SQL Workbench password in the **config.py** file so that you can connect to the database.

## Running the Code

In order to run the code, you will need start by running the **app.py** file. This will give you the endpoint address as a link as shown below:

You will then need to run the **main.py** file in pyCharm which will run the code to interact with the API.
Once the code is running, you will receive a welcome message which contains a link to the endpoint homepage.
You will then be asked questions which if answered with a ***y***, will allow you to add data as well as delete data from he database. The output is shown below:

Finally, you will have a message asking if you would like to view the list of all the biscuits in expiry date order before being thanked for your time.

## Conclusion

I was able to get all of the code working, but had problems getting the endpoints to work for the deleting and adding of data to the database. Unfortunately, I was unable to figure out what was wrong with the code to get it working in the time available to me, but will try and get it working when I have more time.

Thank you for taking the time to interact with **Pharaoh Biscuits**
