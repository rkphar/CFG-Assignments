# Git and GitHub Assignment

## About Me

Hello, my name is Rajindeep Pharwaha, but you can call me **Raj**.
I live in Glasgow and I am a single parent of 2 daughters who are a handful(*especially* the youngest)
I have previously completed the ***Introduction to Python*** course through **Code Firt Girls** as well as a couple of short courses on ***Cyber Security*** through **Skills Development Scotland**

## Assignment

For this assignment, I downloaded **Git** and **GitHub** and set them up as shown in the setup guides. 
I started off by creating a repository called **GitTest** within GitHub and setting it as my master branch on Git. I then added 4 files to the repository to test that I could **add**, **commit** and **push** files to my repository on GitHub from Git as shown below.

I also managed to make 2 branches. I created a **second** and **third** branch. The third branch is illustrated below, but the third branch was then deleted.

I also created a **.gitignore** and a **requirements.txt** file through GitHub which I found the easiest way to do it.

I created a new file in the second branch which was called pulltest.txt to test **pulling**, **branching** and **merging**. I managed to pull and branch through Git, but when merging, I found it easier to do this through GitHub.

I hope you are able to check all of my work on GitHub and all of the different changes which were made. I am aware I am still learning how to use Git and Github properly and it is all trial and error(mostly error just now ðŸ˜•)

Thank you 





# Assignement 4 API

## Getting Started

In order to use this API, you will need to have **Flask** and **mysql.connector** downloaded on your pyCharm.
You will also need to run the database ***Pharaoh*** in SQL and have all of the **.py** files saved on your pyCharm.
Please ensure you have entered you SQL Workbench password in the **config.py** file so that you can connect to the database.

## Running the Code

In order to run the code, you will need start by running the **app.py** file. This will give you the endpoint address as a link as shown below:

You will then need to run the **main.py** file in pyCharm which will run the code to interact with the API.
Once the code is running, you will receive a welcome message which contains a link to the endpoint homepage.
You will then be asked questions which if answered with a ***y***, will allow you to add data as well as delete data from he database. The output is shown below:

Finally, you will have a message asking if you would like to view the list of all the biscuits in expiry date order before being thanked for your time.

## Conclusion

I was able to get all of the code working, but had problems getting the endpoints to work for the deleting and adding of data to the database. Unfortunately, I was unable to figure out what was wrong with the code to get it working in the time available to me, but will try and get it working when I have more time.

Thank you for taking the time to interact with **Pharaoh Biscuits**
